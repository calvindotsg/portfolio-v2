 * `astro:content`, no top-level `await`, and no `.astro` import — directly or through

 * A goal card's way out is this site's own patch wall, not the service the figure came

 *
 * Each card used to carry a call to action pointing at `STRAVA_PROFILE_URL`, which is
 * module-private in `src/content/site.ts` and stays that way — the
 * same place the intro card's social link reaches, so the page spent three of its nine
 * controls on one destination a logged-out visitor cannot see. Both were removed. The
 * link that replaced them is a component rather than three fields on this type
 * (`components/EventsLink.astro`) because it is not a configured destination: the href
 * is derived from the goal's own `sport`, and its label from the goal's own name. There
 * is nothing for an editor to fill in, which is the point — see {@link NEXT_RACE} for
 * the strings, which are the only part a person edits.

 * `type Sport = "running" | "cycling"` independently would let the two drift: a
 * renamed goal would leave events pointing at a sport nothing renders, and the
 * mismatch is invisible — an event whose sport matches no goal contributes to no
 * projection and throws nothing.
 *
 * That derivation only works because `RAW_GOALS` is declared `as const satisfies`
 * rather than with a plain `: Goal[]` annotation. An annotation WIDENS the string
 * literals to `string`, and `Sport` would resolve to `string` — accepting every
 * typo while still type-checking. This is the load-bearing half of the pattern and
 * it looks like a style choice, so: do not "tidy" the declaration back to an
 * annotation. `pnpm check` runs in CI ahead of the tests and gates the deploy, so a
 * real type error here cannot reach production; a widened one is not a type error at all.

 * literal map beside the races —
 *
 *     const SPORT_ICON = {cycling: "ri:riding-line", running: "ri:run-line"}
 *
 * — and it has a failure mode that is invisible in every direction that matters.
 * `uno.config.ts` safelists icon classes by reading LINKS, GOALS, CAREER, WELCOME,
 * FOOTER, NOW and PATCHES; it does not read the race list and has no reason to. So a
 * second table ships icon classes UnoCSS never generated a rule for: correct markup, correct
 * class token, and a mask box painted at zero size. Deriving from the goal means
 * the safelist already covers the wall — there is exactly one place a sport's icon
 * is named, and it is a place the config reads. (Read that list off `uno.config.ts` rather
 * than trusting it here — a copy of it went stale in the very commit that added `PATCHES`
 * to the safelist.)
 *
 * TOTAL BY CONSTRUCTION: {@link Sport} is `typeof RAW_GOALS[number]["sport"]`, so the
 * only values the type admits are the sports of goals that exist, and {@link GOALS}
 * is an unfiltered 1:1 map of `RAW_GOALS`. The `find` therefore cannot miss for any
 * value the compiler will pass it.
 *
 * BUT THE TYPE IS THE ONLY THING SAYING SO, which is why this throws rather than
 * asserting non-null. A review of the patch wall put it as the premise resting on
 * something no gate enforces, and the useful half of that is true: nothing stops a
 * future edit adding a `.filter(…)` to the map above, at which point `Sport` admits a
 * value `GOALS` lacks. With `!` the caller then reads a property of `undefined` two
 * frames away; with the throw it fails at the line that knows what went wrong, and
 * `tests/content.test.ts` covers every sport so the totality is checked rather than
 * merely stated. The condition stays unreachable through the type — this is the
 * failure mode of an edit, not of an input.
