 * The one Strava destination, reached from exactly one control — the social link

 * athlete id inside it has a SECOND sanctioned home that nothing can check:
 * `STRAVA_ATHLETE_ID`, the repository *variable* that
 * `scripts/fetch-strava-progress.mjs` reads. The two hold the same value for
 * different jobs — this decides where a visitor lands, that decides whose
 * kilometres the goal cards show — so changing accounts means editing both, and
 * updating only the variable publishes a stranger's distances under a link to the
 * old profile. README.md's Configuration section is where that is explained; this
 * is the pointer, because this is the half a person edits here.
 *
 * Worth knowing before adding a second, more specific Strava control: there is no
 * public per-sport URL for an athlete. `?activity_type=Run` and
 * `?activity_type=Ride` serve the same page — SHA-256 equal over 544,386
 * characters once the per-request tokens are normalised away — and of 25
 * sport-scoped path shapes tried, every one either 404s or redirects to /login.
 * A logged-out visitor meets a login wall whichever URL they are given, which is
 * why the two goal cards no longer offer one.

     * The reason is that `current_progress` is a DISPLAY value. It exists so an
     * overshot year cannot push the bar past 100%, and arithmetic that reads a value
     * shaped for a progress bar inherits that shaping. The agreement above is a
     * coincidence of two facts that are free to move independently: the clamp's
     * formula, and the threshold the projection happens to compare against. Reading

 * renamed goal would leave events pointing at a sport nothing renders, and the
 * mismatch is invisible — an event whose sport matches no goal contributes to no
 * projection and throws nothing.
 *
 * That derivation only works because `RAW_GOALS` is declared `as const satisfies`
 * rather than with a plain `: Goal[]` annotation. An annotation WIDENS the string
 * literals to `string`, and `Sport` would resolve to `string` — accepting every
 * typo while still type-checking. This is the load-bearing half of the pattern and
 * it looks like a style choice, so: do not "tidy" the declaration back to an
 * annotation. `pnpm check` is the first half of Netlify's build command, so a real
