/**
 * The one Strava destination, reached from exactly one control — the social link
 * below. It is a named constant rather than a literal in that entry because the
 * athlete id inside it has a SECOND sanctioned home that nothing can check:
 * `STRAVA_ATHLETE_ID`, the repository *variable* that
 * `scripts/fetch-strava-progress.mjs` reads. The two hold the same value for
 * different jobs — this decides where a visitor lands, that decides whose
 * kilometres the goal cards show — so changing accounts means editing both, and
 * updating only the variable publishes a stranger's distances under a link to the
 * old profile. README.md's Configuration section is where that is explained; this
 * is the pointer, because this is the half a person edits here.
 *
 * Worth knowing before adding a second, more specific Strava control: there is no
 * public per-sport URL for an athlete. `?activity_type=Run` and
 * `?activity_type=Ride` serve the same page — SHA-256 equal over 544,386
 * characters once the per-request tokens are normalised away — and of 25
 * sport-scoped path shapes tried, every one either 404s or redirects to /login.
 * A logged-out visitor meets a login wall whichever URL they are given, which is
 * why the two goal cards no longer offer one.

 * résumé link announced as "Resume Profile": a PDF is not a profile, and the
 * suffix lived in markup where nobody editing this file could see it.

 * keep one name across both states, and offers the changing name as the alternative
 * to that state rather than an addition to it. See
