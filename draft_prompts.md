## Fix elements in IntroCard component

Improvements required when in mobile view: 
- The text and icons in IntroCard component should not overlaps with the image
- The image should occupy the full height of the container and should not have any transparency
- The elements in the IntroCard component should be mobile responsive.
- The image should not occupy more than 50% of the container width.
- The text and icons should not occupy more than 50% of the container width, stacked vertically.
- Text and icons (stacked vertically) and image (occupying full height) should be side by side in mobile view.
- This only affects the mobile view and does not affect the desktop layout.
